# Customizing Your ChatGPT Personality

A personality is the style and tone ChatGPT uses when responding to you. It is a combination of traits, voice, and behavior that shapes how answers feel, whether that is friendly and casual, concise and professional, or something else entirely.

Changing the personality does not affect what ChatGPT can or cannot do, or the rules it follows for safety. It guides how ChatGPT communicates so you can choose a style that is most useful or enjoyable for you. Personality also does not affect certain types of content you ask it to produce. For example, if you request something like an email draft, code snippet, social media post, or résumé, ChatGPT will match the tone and style to your instructions and the context, not to the selected personality. If you have Friendly selected and ask for Python code to calculate shipping costs, ChatGPT will provide the code in a clear, functional format based on your request — it will not add Friendly’s usual reflective or conversational style.

Your selected personality works alongside any saved memories or custom instructions you’ve set, which allows you to add nuance to any personality you choose. If your memory contains guidance that conflicts with a personality’s style (for example, a saved preference for serious and professional responses), it may override or reduce the visible traits of that personality. Similarly, instructions you give in a conversation can adjust or obscure a personality’s behavior.

| **Default**      | Technically… maybe, but it would be far more “adorably chaotic” than “Wimbledon champion.”  <br>Raccoons are incredibly dexterous — their front paws have five nimble fingers, and they can twist, grab, and manipulate objects with surprising skill (they’re famously able to open jars and unlatch cages). But there are a few challenges:                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Cynical**      | If by “teach” you mean “waste several months of your life trying to convince a trash panda to participate in your strange little Wimbledon fantasy,” then yes, technically, you could try.  <br>Raccoons are clever enough to open jars, steal dog food, and bypass bungee cords, but fine motor skills for swinging a racket? That’s pushing it. You’d probably end up with a very smug raccoon holding the racket like a club while using it to pry open your fridge.                                                                                                  |
| **Efficient**    | Possible but limited.  <br>Raccoons have dexterous forepaws and good problem-solving ability, so they could grip and move a racket. They lack the shoulder rotation, arm length, and muscle power to swing it at useful speed or accuracy. With training, you might get them to hold it, tap a ball, or mimic a motion for food rewards, but not to play tennis in any meaningful sense.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Friendly**     | You could try, but you'd mostly be teaching yourself patience and raccoon first aid.  <br>They’ve got nimble little hands, sure, but zero interest in forehand technique or staying inside the lines. Best case, you get a fuzzy chaos gremlin who enjoys smacking at balls for treats. Worst case, you’re buying a new racket and explaining claw marks to your local sports shop.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Nerdy**        | You could try, but the poor raccoon would be fighting an uphill battle against both physics and biology.  <br>A raccoon’s paws are nimble—good for picking locks, unscrewing jars, and making mischief—but they lack the length, grip strength, and wrist rotation needed to control a tennis racket the way a human does. Even if you made a raccoon-sized racket, you’d still run into the “swing mechanics” problem: their body plan isn’t built for over-the-shoulder or forehand strokes. They move more like short-armed burglars than athletes with a wide reach. |
| **Professional** | Short version: you might be able to train a tame raccoon to   <br>_touch, hold, or drag_  <br>a tennis racket on cue, but you’re not going to get a furry little Serena Williams out of it.  <br>Let’s break down why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Quirky**       | You   <br>_might_  <br>get a raccoon to   <br>_hold_  <br>a tennis racket, but getting it to   <br>_use_  <br>one is a saga fit for a nature documentary narrated by someone barely holding in laughter 🦝🎾.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Candid**       | Short answer:   <br>**not really — at least not in the way you’re picturing.**  <br>Raccoons are   <br>_smart_  <br>and have great dexterity with their paws, but there are a few blockers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
